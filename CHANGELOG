## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2023-10-03

- CMakeLists.txt had inclusion of iconv header flags mismatched with the test for their presence
### Added
- 1986 binary file format implementation
- Added EBCDIC-US to UCS4 conversion table and functions to this project

### Removed
- Removed dependency on iconv for EBCDIC-to-ASCII transcoding
